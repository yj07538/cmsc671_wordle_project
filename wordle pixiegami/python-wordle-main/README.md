This project is for the CMSC671 fall class at UMBC.
This is comprised of code from the pixegami author found on YouTube and GitHub (citations below).

# to play the game load download the wordle pixiegami directory into a file system.
launch the pixigame_modified_play_wordle_with_agent_loop.ipynb jupyter notebook file and run the lines of code down to the main loop.
there is a markdown line that says: The next line runs the game.
The game is interactive currently for a human player using the python input feature in the notebook.
The game is also interactive by an agent through a file implementation where the agent can write guesses to a file.  
The main loop reads the guesses and provides visual feedback.  Data feedback features are under development.  

The code has been modified and scripts added to provide an interface for an agent to play the game.
This is done by writing guesses to the agent_guesses file.  The main loop is run from the "pixigame_modified_play_wordle_with_agent_loop.ipynb" script.  

## This code is the one you will use to run the program.
## It imports from the other python programs.

There is a data directory where the data files are stored.  
These files are code written by this team which includes code from the play_wordle.py file that was written by the original author.

## Agent_guess_writer.ipynb
    This script provides an interface for the agent to write guesses into a file.  That file is embedded in the game loop and the master agent pulls these guesses into the game.
    
## create_5_letter_word_text.ipynb
    This file creates a 5 letter word list from the nltk words data file, extracting the 5 letter words and writing these to a file in the data directory.
    
## pixigame_modified_play_wordle_with_agent_loop.ipynb 
    This script includes code from the original author that has been included, augmented, and modified to support the game interface as well as providing a game loop where the agent software can connect.

## Bug Fix Update

It was pointed out to me that the game didn't behave like Wordle does when two identical letters
are in a 'guess', but only one copy of that letter is in the word.

### Problem

For example, if the guess is HELLO and the secret is APPLE, then the previous behavior causes
the first occurrence of the L to be yellow (because it does appear in the word), but then the second
L will be green (because it is in the right position).

On a letter-by-letter basis, this behavior appears fine. But when the entire word is considered, that
first L shouldn't appear yellow. Instead, it should appear grey. That's because there is already another
L in the guess that 'claims' the occurrence of the L in the secret.

### Solution

* Instead of resolving all the letter results in one-pass, we now first initialize it as an array and
default all guess letters to grey (not in the word).
* We create an list, which is a copy of the secret. Each element corresponds to the letter in the string. 
For example `["A", "P", "P", "L", "E"]`.
* We then do a first pass through the guess, and identify any letters in the correct position. If we find one,
then that letter becomes 'green', and the secret list is updated to void out that letter so it can't be used
in a subsequent comparison. So if we guess "HELLO", the remaining secret becomes something like this:
`["A", "P", "P", "*", "E"]`.
* We then do another loop this time identify the guessed letters which are in the word (by using a nested loop),
but not in position.
